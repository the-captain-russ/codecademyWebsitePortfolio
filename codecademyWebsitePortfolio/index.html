                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Born and raised in the Shenandoah Valley on the western side of Virginia, I enlisted into the US Navy right out of High School where I played keyboard for Navy Band New Orleans. As a part of the Navy Band New Orleans Express unit, I found interest in the technical side of the band: from running sound, hooking up microphones and other equipment to the inner workings of an analog synthesizer, B3 organ, and other types of keyboards</p>
                <p>Post my Navy career of five years, I focused my interest of electronics towards formal education in computer and electronics engineering at ITT Technical Institute.  While completing my associates degree with a 4.0 GPA, I finished courses outside of the electronics field including: introduction to network technology and a intro to programming course, where the instructor noticed an astuteness for the subject and suggested I switch from the electronics degree towards a software related field; however, I continued on with my electronics path and graduated  from ITT in 2009 with a AAS in Computer & Electroncis Engineering.</p>
                <p>With the Associates Degree under my belt, I moved back the VA and started a trek of mixed experience:</p>
